Thank you for sharing the investor deck.  I am interested to see the financial plan as well.  A few quick questions - 

1.  You are currently raising 2.5 crores of capital.  How long do you expect this capital to last and what is your subsequent plan thereafter?  

2.  What is the extent of inventory that you hold on an average as compared to your turnover?

3. How many weavers supply to you?  Is this an exlcusive arrangement for them or can they sell to other stores?   Do you buy the sarees from the weavers or do you sell on their behalf ? Stock in trade vs consignment basis?  

4.  In your assessment, where do you see Sarangi over the next 10 years?

5.  Finally, whats the exit route for investors who are coming in now.

Vishal Dedhia,FinoZen,"1) What are the RBI&#47;Sebi&#47;Banking norms&#47;guidelines&#47;licenses applicable for such venture?
2) Which MF offers upto 4.5% p.a. on Liquid Funds?
3) At 0.5% margins&#47;commissions p.a, you need to scale up 150 times from here just to make up for the monthly burning of 2 Lakhs. And such scaling up will increase the Monthly burning exponentially. How do you justify the same?
4) At an AUM of 1000 CR with 1% commission, it would take 13 years to reach the current post money valuation of 10.83 Crore assuming there is absolutely zero expenditure. Taking into consideration the burn rate of 2 lakhs, it would at least double up the payback time to 25 Years. How did you reach this kind of valuation at current income levels of 20,000 per month?",,

I am an angel investor at Lets Venture, and work at Bain as a Principal in my day job. I think you folks are on to something interesting, so would love to talk. (Doesn&#39;t have to be all of you of course :). Here are some pre-discussion questions I have as food for thought 

1. Why did you need to use syndication from Lets Venture? To get the round done in quick time?
2. You have used $50 as average ticket size for sizing the market - that&#39;s your B2C historical average sure, but don&#39;t you think the average would be much lower at a market level?
3. This is THE big question for me. why would you try to expand to 10 cities in 1st year and not densely cover the 3 you are in and become insanely established, profitable and get your repeatable model in place. This is a local market share game; a fact way too many local services players have messed up on.   
4. You provide temporary &#47; loaner to B2C customers as well? How has the loaner device breakage &#47; problem rate been (i.e .when the customer returns)

If in Delhi &#47; NCR, would love to catch up in person else we can do a call. Thanks, and look forward

Dr Bimal John,Travel Jar,"Hi Abhinav, 

I tried installing the app on my phone to give it a try. However, I had some issues. Firstly,  in the permissions it&#39;s asking for too many things like (don&#39;t remember exactly now which all specifically)  contacts, calls, location, etc. These should be enabled on a need basis by the user than be a blanket setting. Especially at this stage when you are a newbie, users will have privacy concerns. I couldn&#39;t get past this stage. Also I noticed it automatically created a profile folder in my pictures. So these are all red flags from a user point of view. Just sharing feedback and my personal views which may be wrong technically. 

Regarding investment, I am open to it as I liked the idea. However, the dilution is not attractive. At this stage, I would want a higher equity for any investment. Again this is my preliminary thought based on currently available information.

Have a quick question on the cash collection aspect. How does the payment work between the customer, Ressy and merchant? 

Scenario 1: Customers pays 100% to Ressy. Ressy takes the commission and passes the rest to the merchant. 

Scenario 2: Customers pays 100% to merchant. Ressy then takes the commission from the merchant.  In this case, how does the cash reconciliation cycle work? Is it weekly&#47;monthly remittance from merchant to Ressy? 

Which one of these is Ressy following.

What you are upto is truly going to make the world flat. The market you are creating goes against the flow of conventional wisdom. But there is definitely a very huge potential building this. At least in terms of the startup ecosystem here in India, there is definitely a huge need in terms of good product managers, UX experts and content creation folks. Expatriates could also help in taking good product companies from emerging markets globally.

I&#39;d love to see how i can be of help in your journey. Would love to invest in this round as well. 
Have you guys thought about the convertible debt terms yet?

2. How do you plan to compete with real time live satellite data feed which is available (almost) and can track the availability of spots. It will also not have any overhead cost - no embedded sensors/trackers.

Amit Mehta,Justride.in,what is the valuation expectation?,,
R Maheswari,www.kopykitab.com,"Hi,

It is a really interesting product we have here. I have a question though.
Where do we stand with the new eBasta inititative which is a part of the digital india programme of Govt of India which are essentially going to make all school, and board books available to download free.
This would leave only other prep and reference books which might ultimately have a lot of competition from Flipkart and Amazon among others.

Having been in sales and marketing for most of my 25+  years career, I know how difficult it is to acquire customers, let alone get them on the tap. So, I must confess that I was a bit skeptical when I heard about your ""Customer on Demand"" paradigm during your yesterday's web conference. However, as your presentation progressed, I was increasigly able to appreciate your perspective and am more inclined in participating in your investment round now.  

I've helped a couple of companies build software in the targeted offers space and have some thoughts especially around reinforcing the Ressi value proposition for the consumer. I'm happy to share my insights with you. I live in Pune and it might be ideal to do this via a F2F meeting. But I couldn't figure out your office location - mine is in Viman Nagar - from your website / elsewhere and, besides, I'm off on vacation the next week and am a bit pressed for time. 

If you like, we can talk on the phone sometime tomorrow.

I run a marketing solutions company and recently completed the product specs for a non-retailer facing B2B CEM platform.  I've been using KeyRing for several years. In India, I've never been able to find a single retailer who has been able to scan the barcode off of my smartphone screen to credit rewards. Curious to know if you've solved this problem. I also recently came across an Indian startup called Smart Pocket or something like that in your space. Compared to KeyRing this app sucked big time and I promptly uninstalled it.

I just came across your company and thought of writing to you. 

Just as a quick introduction: I co-lead Katalyzers, a platform backed by TPG as well as an early stage fund backed by Smile Group. We are shareholders in Airbnb and have built companies that we exited to WPP, etc. Our USP is that we as a team have extensive operating experience, which puts us in a great position to truly help companies.

I was hoping if we could chat regarding CallTruck. Our team maybe in Bangalore on the 7th and if everything goes well, we should look towards setting up an in-person meeting. If interested, I'm reachable at rishabh@katalyzers.com. Let me know

Vikas Verma,Urjakart,"Well, itâ€™s a great start and I love the name UrjaKart.  Doesn't sound like a typical home improvement brand â€¦ Nonetheless, a clear niche area. Additionally, I think the name does not depict what a full service home improvement store carries i.e. the following categories as the bare minimum:
-	Appliances
-	Lawn and Garden
-	Storage
-	Flooring 
-	Home Decor
-	Electrical
-	Lighting 
-	Doors 
-	Tools, Automation etc. 
What are your growth plans?  Where do you think scale will come from; which categories or segments? 
I saw you mentioned you are not a marketplace.  Do you carry the inventory then?  If not, whatâ€™s the system to get full visibility of resellers? 
I think itâ€™s a good first mover advantage.  There are other adjacent areas to carve out the niche as well.  Would love to know your plan for scaling the business.  
I also observed some good things about the site and a few areas of development.  More when we talk.

Any revenue and paid-user conversions?

Soumitra Sharma,YoApp,"Hi Prasanna,

Great to e-connect on LV. Quickly introducing myself, I am leading Corporate Development and India Expansion Plans for Quixey (https://www.quixey.com/). The company is an emerging global leader in mobile app search, driven by our proprietary Functional Search and Deep Views technology. It has raised $75mn till now, and is funded by Alibaba Group, in addition to other VCs such as GGV Capital, US Venture Partners, SK Planet etc. 

Quixey is one of the key strategic investments by Alibaba globally. The company is rapidly scaling up in markets like US and China, and already has offices in San Francisco (HQ), Beijing and Tel Aviv.

Prior to Quixey, I was a VC at IDG Ventures India (Bangalore office), and was focused on early and expansion stage technology investments. During my VC stint, I invested in Forus Health, Newgen Software, Aujas Networks and eShakti.com.

Would love to meet and understand more about Yo App. Am in Pune on Thu, 17 July, and was wondering if you would be available for a meeting. If this sounds good, please drop me a line on soumitra@quixey.com. My India number is 855 321 4006.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Saisree Subramanian,Testbook.com,"Hi,
I had attended your pitching session a couple of weeks back and have a few questions on your presentation
1) Have you considered partnering with one of the traditional coaching institutes?  What are your thoughts on such partnerships, especially when you mention that the coaching market is growing at 16%?
2) As per your competitor analysis, two of your competitors use video while you do not.   Do you not think that video based content is a requirement in your marketspace?
3) In your SWOT analysis, you mention lack of financial resources as a weakness - can you elaborate on this?
